🛠️ Development Process

To be able develop this bot I used Python as well as Visual Studio Code as the main development environment. I had to design and create slash commands to  handle every complex command interactions that all players will need to use for example: battles, point tracking, and announcements, After fully completing this I was able to run beta tests to help with previewing the bot directly within the Discord Esports Server to ensure the had proper functionality and user-friendly interaction. Throughout development, The features was added and refined based on how the Esports server would realistically use the bot, ensuring all the commands were simple, efficient, and user-friendly.

While building and creating this project, I was able to learn how to properly structure and layout a Esports Discord bot to ensure help and support within competitive gameplay. This helped me gain a lot of experience working with Discord slash commands, managing how player interactions work, handling permissions for admin-only commands to make sure only people with a set role id can use these commands, as well as learning how to organize the bot’s logic to scale so new features can be added. This project helped me better understand how discord bot systems operate within community-driven platforms like Discord.
